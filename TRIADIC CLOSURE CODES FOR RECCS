##Triadic closure: The tendency of nodes orentities in a network who share relations to
become connected themselves
USE TRIADIC CLUOSURE TO MAKE RECCS BASED ON LOCATION OF USERS AND SIMILARITY OF TASTES

****RECC#1 BASED ON USER LOCATION: SIMPLE GRAPH, DISTANCE AS WEIGHTS. CLOSENESS CENTRALITY.***
#Use this to make recommendations based on location (Closeness centrality, weights determined by distance)

#To figure out local clustering coefficient.
nx.average_clustering(Simple_Graph)

#Include latitutde and longitude information 
#(Tabitha is downloading a google package to map, 
#if that doesn't work, we can use distance formula for lat and long.

#Determine distance between the two nodes 
nx.all_simple_paths(Graph, Node1, Node2)
nx.shortest_path(Graph, Node1, Node2)
nx.shortest_path_length(Graph, Node1,
Node2)

****RECC#2 BASED ON USERS WITH SIMILAR TASTES: SIMILARITY. BIPARTITE GRAPH, DEGREE CENTRALITY, USING GLOBAL CLUSTERING COEFF.
#GLOBAL CLUSTERING COEFFICIENT
nx.average_clustering(Graph)

#using bipartite graph USERS VS COFFEE SHOPS

#determine degree centrality local cluStering coeffic

#Is this user strongly connected?? 
nx.is_strongly_connected(Graph)
